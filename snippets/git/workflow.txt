FAQ -:

1. How to set executable bit on files?
 - By default, Git changes the permissions of all the files to 644. So, we have no other option to manually enter a rectifiying command to set the bit. After `git add <file>`, enter -:
 
git update-index --chmod=+x <file>

NOTE: This can create potential security holes, and is rather laborious. Also, this is not required in 99% of cases. So, think deeply before you do this.
